## 🚀 How to Use This Documentation

### For Self-Study
1. Start with SOLID principles if you're new to these concepts
2. Each principle includes theory, violations, corrections, and real-world examples
3. Move to Enterprise patterns once comfortable with SOLID
4. Practice with ERP-specific examples to understand business contexts

### For Interview Preparation
1. Review common interview questions first
2. Practice explaining each principle in simple terms
3. Be ready to identify violations in code samples
4. Understand how patterns solve real business problems

### Key Learning Approach
- **Understand the Problem**: Why does each principle/pattern exist?
- **See the Violation**: Recognize bad code that violates principles
- **Learn the Solution**: Understand how to apply principles correctly
- **Practice Implementation**: Write code that follows best practices
- **Apply to Business**: Connect to real ERP scenarios

## 💡 Quick Reference

### SOLID Principles Summary
- **S**RP: One class, one responsibility, one reason to change
- **O**CP: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**SP: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**SP: Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface
- **D**IP: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Enterprise Patterns Summary
- **Repository**: Abstracts data access logic
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Observer**: Defines one-to-many dependency between objects

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this documentation, you will:

✅ **Understand** all SOLID principles with real-world analogies  
✅ **Identify** principle violations in existing code  
✅ **Apply** principles to create maintainable, testable code  
✅ **Implement** enterprise patterns in C# correctly  
✅ **Design** ERP system components following best practices  
✅ **Answer** technical interview questions confidently  
✅ **Refactor** legacy code to follow SOLID principles  
✅ **Choose** appropriate patterns for specific business scenarios  

## 📈 Progression Path

```
Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert
    ↓           ↓            ↓         ↓
  Theory    Examples    Patterns   Architecture
```

1. **Beginner**: Learn theory, understand violations
