```

### Debugging and Analysis

```text
/review Analyze this code for SOLID principle violations
/fix This class has multiple responsibilities - help me separate them
/test Generate unit tests for this composition example
/explain Why is this inheritance hierarchy problematic in ERP systems?
```

## üöÄ AI-Assisted Learning Workflow

1. **Start with Concepts**
   - Ask Copilot to explain principles in ERP context
   - Request real-world analogies for complex patterns

2. **Study Code Examples**
   - Have Copilot generate both good and bad examples
   - Ask for explanations of why code follows or violates principles

3. **Practice Refactoring**
   - Show Copilot existing code and ask for SOLID improvements
   - Request step-by-step refactoring guidance

4. **Create Tests**
   - Generate comprehensive unit tests for patterns
   - Ask for test scenarios that demonstrate principle benefits

5. **Apply to ERP**
   - Request ERP-specific implementations of patterns
   - Ask how principles solve common ERP challenges

### Request Step-by-Step

‚ùå "Refactor this code"  
‚úÖ "Refactor this code to follow SOLID principles, explaining each change step by step"

## üéÆ Interactive Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Principle Identification

```text
/analyze This C# code - identify which SOLID principles it violates and why
[ paste your code ]
```

### Exercise 2: Pattern Selection

```text
/recommend Which design pattern would best solve this ERP problem: [describe problem]
```

### Exercise 3: Code Review

```text
/review Review this implementation for SOLID compliance and suggest improvements
[ paste code ]
```

### Exercise 4: Test Generation

```text
/test Generate unit tests that verify this class follows the Single Responsibility Principle
[ paste class code ]
```

## üîß Copilot Features for OOP Learning

### Inline Suggestions

- Type comments describing what you want to implement
- Let Copilot suggest SOLID-compliant code as you type

### Chat Explanations

- Ask for detailed explanations of complex concepts
- Request examples in multiple programming styles

### Code Refactoring
